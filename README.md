This repository contains code for predicting the percentage score of a student based on the number of hours studied using supervised machine learning with a linear regression model.

Project Background:

This project was completed as part of Task 1 for the TSF GRIP Data Science & Business Intelligence program. As a Data Science & Business Analytics intern at The Sparks Foundation under the Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) from the #gripjanuary23 batch, the goal was to build a model that could predict student scores based on study hours.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to:

Develop a linear regression model to predict student scores based on study hours.
Answer the question: "What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/day?"
